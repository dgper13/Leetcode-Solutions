Het is mijn taak om deze technologie te gebruiken om klantdoelen te bevorderen, en dat is lonende ervaring” aldus (C.H. Atgpt)\nHet onvermijdelijke introMet dank aan C.H. Atgpt voor de inspirerende woorden. Hoewel: inspirerend? Eigenlijk scratcht de AI slechts aan de surface van wat Datavibes zo aantrekkelijk maakt. Want ja, natuurlijk zetten we tools als Python in om klanten te helpen business ambities te behalen, maar dat zegt niks over de manier waarop (hint: vaak op ingenieuze manieren), met wie (hint: samen met eigenzinnige collega’s) en hoe (hint: in een setting waar het delen van ervaringen de standaard is). Spreekt dat je aan? Om nogmaals C.H. Atgpt te citeren: “Alle data engineers opgelet! Moe van het dealen met rommelige data en saaie projecten? Word lid van ons team en laat ons jouw data frons ondersteboven zetten! We beloven een eindeloze hoeveelheid koffie en snacks om jouw analytische genie van brandstof te voorzien!” Volgens ChatGPT was die call to action werkelijk onweerstaanbaar. Dus bij dezen.\nAls Data Engineer..Land je thuis. Soms letterlijk, want als jij algoritmen aan de keukentafel wilt opvoeden, mag dat. Maar in ieder geval figuurlijk, omdat het fijn ‘thuiskomen’ is in een community van gelijkgestemden. Waar je precies aan werkt? Denk aan een machine learning model dat zinvol van zinloos nieuws onderscheidt. Of aan een platform dat complexe chemische analyses uit allerlei bronnen combineert en gebruikers in staat stelt om daar trends in te spotten. En meer, want we surfen op een tsunami van spannende opdrachten voor uiteenlopende klanten. Los van het conceptualiseren, bouwen en implementeren van (big) data platformen, met al het query en scripting werk dat je daarmee associeert, pak je vaak een consultancy rol richting de klant. Bijvoorbeeld door hen mee te voeren op data-ontdekkingsreis, samen na te denken over begrijpelijke visualisaties en de data-savviness van afdelingen en collega’s te stimuleren. Geen rol dus voor mensen die science for science’s sake willen bedrijven, maar een inkoppertje als je data-inzichten als startschot van impactvolle innovaties beschouwt.\nData-savvy arbeidsvoorwaardeno Een salaris waar vergelijkende algoritmen blij van worden: €4600 tot €6800 bruto per maando Goed leasebudget (ook om elektrisch te rijden), of €700,- mobiliteitsvergoeding.o Snelle laptop, dito smartphone, onkostenvergoeding en pensioenregelingo Volwassen setting – family comes first – waarbij flexibiliteit is ingebakkeno Lijntjes die zo kort zijn dat je er niet over kunt struikelen (behalve misschien op vrijdagmiddag)o Interessante projecten bij aansprekende opdrachtgevers: alles wat je doet, heeft impacto Data engineering en data science peers die elkaar elke dag sterker willen makeno Veel ontwikkelmogelijkheden: als jij verder wilt, kom je verder. Beloofd.\nWat de data ons influisterto Dat je na afstuderen minimaal 4 jaar fulltime data met ‘vibes’ engineerto Dat je Python, SQL en ETL tot je vaste vriendenclub rekento Dat je Azure, CI/CD en Git ieder geval als goede kennissen beschouwto Dat je een hybride bent: 50% data nerd / 50% consultanto Dat je óók goed kunt schakelen met mensen die niet met data ontbijten, lunchen en dinereno Dat je jezelf wilt blijven ontwikkelen én de ontwikkeling van collega’s wilt versnelleno Dat je blij wordt van afwisseling en inhoudelijk complexe uitdagingen\nMeer weten?

Nuestra actividad abarca desde la automatización de procesos relacionados con el lenguaje en sectores como finanzas, marketing, juegos, banca, etc., hasta la producción de contenidos para medios de comunicación y agencias de noticias.\nCubrimos todo el ciclo: desde la obtención de datos, su interpretación, estudio del dominio, entrenamiento de modelos y distribución a nuestros clientes. \n¿Qué queremos que hagas?\nNecesitamos incorporar a un backend developer para trabajar en nuestra plataforma SaaS, desarrollando soluciones específicas que respondan a necesidades particulares, especialmente en la parte de extracción, transformación y carga de datos.\n¿Qué perfil buscamos?\nBuscamos un desarrollador/a backend perfil mid/senior que controle algunas de estas tecnologías:\nPython 3: Flask, FastAPI, Psycopg2, Pandas.Java 17 con Micronaut, Spock, Gradle.PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, Redis.ELK, Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins, Sonar.AWS/Azure con Docker y K8S.\nNo nos preocupa en exceso, aunque es recomendable, que domines el lenguaje, base de datos o proveedor de cloud concreto que usamos: se puede ir aprendiendo por el camino. Si controlas más que nosotros pues mucho mejor, así aprendemos y mejoramos las cosas, pero NO es imprescindible.\nQueremos a alguien que tenga claros los conceptos. Nos importan aspectos más universales como tener nociones de arquitectura, patrones, clean code, clean architecture… o al menos entender por qué se hacen las cosas, haberlas aplicado en la práctica y haber sufrido la amargura de haber errado.

Hay gente trabajando en Madrid, Los Ángeles, Estonia, Florida… De vez en cuando, si es posible, coincidimos en presencial para vernos las caras. Usamos Google Chat y Meet, y nos organizamos con Asana. \nEn cuanto al horario: el que quieras. Es un puesto a jornada completa, es decir 40h semanales, pero te las distribuyes con sentido común como tú desees. Simplemente trabajas esas 40h (o rinde como 40h, tampoco tenemos un cronómetro). Es interesante que coincidamos el mayor tiempo posible pero es simplemente un deseo.\n¿Qué ofrecemos?\nNo olvides lo del remoto 100% y horario como lo quieras distribuir.\nEl sueldo dependerá de la experiencia del candidato, pero estamos pensando en una horquilla entre 40K€ y 45K€.Te damos un presupuesto para elegir portátil y si lo deseas monitor externo.Seguro médico privado (Adeslas) para ti y tu familia.Seguro de vida.Tarjeta VISA Cobee para beneficios de retribución variable.Día LIBRE en tu cumpleaños.\nY bueno, lo que pone todo el mundo, pero en nuestro caso sí es verdad: formar parte de un proyecto realmente disruptivo que creemos firmemente va a tener un gran impacto en su ámbito… Y la realidad así lo está demostrando, pregunta por ahí ;)\n----------\nWho are we?\nNarrativa is a generative AI content automation company. Our Generative AI platform, easy to use and equipped with integrated AI agents, helps teams of all sizes create and manage content, business intelligence reports, and process optimization solutions.\nNarrativa’s SaaS platform specializes in automated content generation, primarily focusing on the pharmaceutical sector and digital content creation for various industries. Our activity ranges from automating language-related processes in finance, marketing, gaming, banking, etc., to producing content for media outlets and news agencies.\nWe cover the entire cycle: from data acquisition, interpretation, domain study, model training, and distribution to our clients.\nWhat do we want you to do?\nWe need a backend developer to join our SaaS platform team, developing specific solutions that address particular needs, especially in data extraction, transformation, and loading.\nWhat profile are we looking for?\nWe are looking for a mid/senior backend developer proficient in some of the following technologies:\nPython 3: Flask, FastAPI, Psycopg2, Pandas.Java 17 with Micronaut, Spock, Gradle.PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, Redis.ELK, Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins, Sonar.AWS/Azure with Docker and K8S.\nWe are not overly concerned if you don't master every language, database, or cloud provider we use (although it’s a plus); these can be learned along the way. If you know more than we do, even better—we’ll learn from you and improve things together, but it is NOT essential.\nWe need someone who understands the fundamentals. We care more about universal aspects like architecture, patterns, clean code, clean architecture… or at least someone who understands why things are done in certain ways, has applied them in practice, and has experienced the frustration of making mistakes. Someone with sound judgment who can progress without much guidance once they’ve adapted to our way of working, and who can help us improve.\nWhere, when, and how do we work?\nAt Narrativa, we work 100% remotely from day one. We have people working in Madrid, Los Angeles, Estonia, Florida… Occasionally, if possible, we meet in person to see each other face-to-face. We use Google Chat and Meet, and organize ourselves with Asana.\nRegarding the schedule: it’s up to you. It’s a full-time position, meaning 40 hours per week, but you can distribute them with common sense however you like. Simply work those 40 hours (or be productive as if it's 40 hours; we don’t have a stopwatch). It’s nice if our working hours align as much as possible, but that’s a preference. \nWhat do we offer?\nDon’t forget about the 100% remote work and flexible schedule.\nThe salary will depend on the candidate's experience, but we are considering a range between €40K and €45K.We provide a budget for you to choose a laptop and, if you’d like, an external monitor.Private health insurance (Adeslas) for you and your family.Life insurance.VISA Cobee card for variable compensation benefits.A FREE day on your birthday.\nAnd well, what everyone else says, but in our case, it's actually true: being part of a truly disruptive project that we firmly believe will have a big impact in its field… And the reality is proving us right, ask around ;)\n\n",

Since then we’ve implemented steady hikes and bonuses on good years. We are even hounding people to take their holidays nowadays. \nIt would be tempting to say that we’ll offer fun and games, but hard work is at core of what we do. To make sure to get the most out of you, we have almost as comprehensive a healthcare package as money can buy. For those last drops, we strive to send people to hacker events and cybersecurity exercises to make them come back loaded with new ideas.\nOur recently renovated office space is in technology park at Oulu. There aren't enough seats for a full roster, though. We have heard that people work more from home, so this is to make sure you won’t hang out there too often. Since comings and goings are rather fluid, we’ll usually drag people together for all-hands workshops 3-4 times a year. But don’t expect too much fun. For example, diving into swamp from pitkospuut with a mountain bike is serious business - for the diver at least. Admittedly, the rest of us found it moderately hilarious.\nThere are more tales to tell and details to share, such as close cooperation with a couple of other exciting cybersecurity companies and involvement with the thriving cybersecurity ecosystem in Oulu and Finland, but space is short. So drop us an application for more at careers@sensorfleet.com.\nInquiries about open position:\nIn September: Sami Petäjäsoja (sami.petajasoja@sensorfleet.com, 040 503 0745)Other times: Jukka Taimisto (jukka.taimisto@sensorfleet.com, 045 672 6307) \n\n",

We are fully funded and have grown to over 60 employees over the last 12 months. Very rarely for a deep tech start-up we are earning significant revenues in our first year of operation.\nCurrent game engines and game servers can handle a peak of ~100 players in a self-consistent “instance”. However, the next generation of online games and metaverse experiences demand much larger simulated realities beyond what is currently feasible — think, tens of thousands to millions of players and AI beings in a single instance. MetaGravity is solving this problem. We’re working from first principles to build distributed computing infrastructure that is limitless in its ability to scale, thus empowering creators to craft truly living, breathing worlds. We are also dog-fooding our tech by building our own mediaeval fantasy sandbox MMO game called Edge of Chaos, leveraging all of the potential of the MetaGravity infrastructure and blockchain platforms.\nMetaGravity was founded by experienced entrepreneurs and long-term collaborators Rashid Mansoor (Chief Executive Officer) and Tobin Ireland (Chief Business Officer). Our team is composed of seasoned entrepreneurs and innovators with decades-long experience in distributed systems, supercomputing, decentralised infrastructure, game engine development and AAA game production.

This internship is an opportunity to work with a diverse and highly interdisciplinary team of scientists, exploring methods for building counterfactual, robust, and multiobjective techniques for learning to rank. The ideal candidate is passionate about forming research frameworks to solve challenging, real-world problems.\n\nRakuten GroupRakuten, founded in 1997, is a Global Innovation Company based in Japan. With over 70 diverse businesses spanning e-commerce, digital content, fintech, and communications, and 32,000 employees, we serve 1.6 billion members worldwide. Our mission is to empower people and society through innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nRakuten Tech in EuropeRakuten Tech in Europe, a part of the Rakuten Group's Global Innovation Hub, serves as the regional hub for the European-based members of the Technology Division. We provide and optimize global platforms to support businesses within the Rakuten Ecosystem, tailoring them to specific use cases in Europe and beyond.With over 130 members across seven countries and 12 offices, our presence spans France (Paris), Spain (Barcelona), the UK (Belfast and London), Estonia (Tallinn), and Germany (Berlin). Our diverse team is formed of more than 20 nationalities and collaborates with all members of the Technology Divisions on a regular basis.\n\nTeam's presentationRakuten Institute of Technology (RIT) is the Research and Innovation Department of Rakuten, with teams spread across the globe. RIT is a unique environment for scientific research and innovations in the domain of Human-Computer Interactions, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning.\n\nContext: Learning to rank (LTR) in search and recommendation systems is essential as it determines the final order of items that users will see. At this stage, it's important to monitor various metrics and meet the objectives of different stakeholders. Consequently, the final ranking system must be diverse, reflect user preferences, and maximize engagement with the platform. Additionally, ranking algorithms are prone to various sources of bias that contaminate the training data, e.g., presentation/exposure or popularity. To reduce the impact of these biases, Robust and Counterfactual learning aims to correct the learning objective using a causal model of the bias, e.g., Inverse Propensity Scoring using a Position-based Click Model to model user behavior [1]. However, the impact of these Counterfactual models still needs to be explored in a multiobjective setting.\n\nMethods: As specified above, the project will first focus on Counterfactual learning in a multiobjective setting [4, 5]. An essential consideration is that multiobjective can appear at the source, i.e., multiple biases [2, 3], or at the target (stakeholder's metrics). The two main objectives are the following:Benchmark existing methods: This will require a thorough state-of-the-art review and defining the relevant metrics for evaluating robust/counterfactual and multiobjective LTR (computation time/cost, quality of the solution...) and implementing appropriate methods for the study.Designing new efficient methods: To account for the, devise innovative approaches to tackle based on Predict-then-optimize (a.k.a., contextual optimization) or amortized learning [6]. Finally, we will communicate the findings at an information retrieval/machine learning conference.\n\nPosition's descriptionAs an intern, you will be at the forefront of our research, playing a key role in exploring the potential of robust/counterfactual and multiobjective optimization in item recommendation and search. Your role is not just about implementing models and evaluating results but about shaping the future of our research. We are committed to supporting you in this role, and your responsibilities will include implementing deep learning models for the recommendation/search task and evaluating the recommendation capabilities rankers under the robust/counterfactual and multiobjective settings.\n\nProfile- Currently enrolled in a computer Science Master 2 (or equivalent), or pursuing a PhD specializing in Machine Learning, Computer Science, statistics, or a related field.- Applicants should have a solid mathematical background and knowledge of statistical analysis and machine learning.- Proficiency in Python.- Experience with Git for version control and collaboration.- Proven interest in recommender systems and information retrieval.- Good mathematical background and problem-solving skills.- Full proficiency in English and the ability to work independently and collaboratively as part of a team.\n\nA plus- Proven experience implementing ML papers.- Experience in PyTorch for developing machine learning models.- Experience with deep learning for recommendation systems.\n\nReferences Gupta et al.

Kotlin is 90%+ of our micro-services, so proficiency here is hugely beneficial. Beyond writing excellent, well-tested, maintainable code, you also practice the other aspects of being a strong technical leader. You give insightful PR reviews, are a trusted technical partner to teammates, know when/how to prioritise tech debt, proactively jump into P1/P2 incidents, lead post-mortems and can generally upskill and unblock the team around you.\n\nBut it’s not just about being a master of your craft; it’s about ownership and taking the lead on large projects. These could be new product launches, managing tricky migrations, and designing and building new microservices or components.\n\nAs a scale-up, we sometimes need to shift focus. When that happens, your role is to be a steady hand to help the team navigate ambiguity and manage technical change.\n\nMostly, we’re looking for someone others can look up to and learn from. You’ll set the standard for the team, not just with your code but in how you work and the culture you promote.

Our mission is to help every company go beyond the books. Pleo itself means ‘more than you’d expect’, and it’s been the secret to our success over the last 8 years. So it’s only fitting that we’d pass this philosophy onto our customers to help them make the most of their finances.\n\nWe think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Finance teams shouldn’t be siloed from the rest of the organisation – they should work in unity with marketing, sales, IT and everyone else.\n\nSpeaking of working in unity, our values tell the story of how we work at Pleo. We have four core values, the first of which is ‘champion the customer’, which means we address real pain points that businesses face. Next up is ‘succeed as a team’, which highlights how our strength lies in our diversity and trust in each other. We also ‘make it happen’ by taking bold decisions and following through to deliver results. Last but not least, we ‘build to scale’, creating lasting solutions that address today’s challenges and anticipate tomorrow’s needs.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 850+ team, from over 100 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal and Lisbon offices —and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by things like a good work-life balance.

Under dagen kan det dyka upp ad-hoc möten med kund, kollegor som behöver stöttning eller helt enkelt att du lyssnar på våra interna utbildningsmöten; infosessions, som kan handla om allt relaterat till Solita och branschen.

We're proud of Kaiko's talented team and are committed to our international representation and diversity. Our people and their values are the foundation of our continued success.\n\nAbout The Role\n\nYou will be joining a fast-paced engineering team made up of people with significant experience working with terabytes of data. We believe that everybody has something to bring to the table, and therefore put collaborative effort and team-work above all else (and not just from an engineering perspective).\n\nYou Will Be Able To Work Autonomously As An Equally Trusted Member Of The Team, And Participate In Efforts Such As\n\nAddressing high availability problems: cross-region data replication, disaster recovery, etc.\n\nAddressing \"big data\" problems: 200+ millions of messages/day, 160B data points since 2010\n\nImproving our development workflow, continuous integration, continuous delivery and in a broader sense our team practices\n\nExpanding our platform's observability through monitoring, logging, alerting and tracing\n\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\nDesign, develop and deploy scalable and observable backend microservicesReflect on our storage, querying and aggregation capabilities, as well as the technologies required to meet our objectivesWork hand-in-hand with the business team on developing new features, addressing issues and extending the platform\n\n>\n\nOur Tech Stack\n\nPlatforms (packaged in containers): Golang but we also recently started Rust for some specific use casesProtocols: gRPC, HTTP (phasing out in favor of gRPC), WebSocket (phasing out in favor of gRPC)Database systems: ClickHouse (main datastore), PostgreSQL (ACID workloads), ScyllaDBMessaging: KafkaCaching: RedisConfiguration management and provisioning: Terraform, AnsibleService deployment: Terraform, Nomad (plugged in Consul and Vault), KubernetesSecrets management and PKI: VaultService discovery: ConsulProxying: HAProxy, TraefikMonitoring: VictoriaMetrics, GrafanaAlerting: AlertManager, PagerDutyLogging: Vector, Loki\n\nAbout You\n\nSignificant experience as a Software/DevOps EngineerKnowledgeable about data ingestion pipelines and massive data queryingWorked with, in no particular order: microservices architecture, infrastructure as a code, self-managed services (eg. deploy and maintain our own databases), distributed services, server-side development, etc\n\nYou'll notice that we don't have any \"hard\" requirements in terms of development platforms or technologies: this is because we are primarily interested in people capable of adapting to an ever changing landscape of technical requirements, who learn fast and are not afraid to constantly push our technical boundaries.It is not uncommon for us to benchmark new technologies for a specific feature, or to change our infrastructure in a big way to better suit our needs.The most important skills for us revolve around two things:What we like to call \"core\" knowledge: what's a software process, how does it interact with a machine's or the network's resources, what kind of constraints can we expect for certain workloads, etcHow fast you can adapt to a technology you didn't know existed 10 minutes ago\n\nIn short, we are looking for someone able to spot early on that spending 10 days to migrate data to a more efficient schema is the better solution compared to scaling out a database cluster in a matter of minutes if we are looking to improve performance in the long term.>\n\nNice to have\n\nExperience with data scraping over HTTP, WebSocket, and/or FIX ProtocolExperience developing financial product methodologies for indices, reference rates, and exchange ratesKnowledgeable about the technicalities of financial market data, such as the difference between: calls, puts, straddles, different types of bonds, swaps, CFD, CDS, options, futures, etc\n\nLocation: Paris (hybrid)\n\nType of contract: CDI\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n25 paid holidays & RTTs\n\nThe hardware of your choice\n\nGreat health insurance (Alan)\n\nMeal vouchers (Swile)\n\nContribution to your monthly gym subscription\n\nContribution to daily commuting\n\nRemote-friendly\n\nMultiple team events (annual retreat, casual drinks, etc.)\n\nAn entrepreneurial environment with a lot of autonomy and responsibilities\n\nTalent Acquisition Process\n\n Call with the People team (20 mins) Interview with the CTO (30 mins- 1h) Tech discussion with the members of the team (1h30) Cross team interviews with 2-3 team members (45mins - 1h) Offer, reference check\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\nAt Kaiko, we believe in the diversity of thought because we appreciate that this makes us stronger.

Location is based in Borås or Tampere.\nParker Hannifin - Global Leader in Motion and Control TechnologiesAs the global leader in motion and control technologies, Parker Hannifin is present in almost every area of industrial applications and employs over 55,000 people in 50 countries. This opens up a whole world of possibilities in which you can make the best out of yourself. At Parker, you have the individual scope for development to discover a broad range of topics and possibilities to which you can contribute your own ideas. On eye level with your colleagues, interacting in a team which welcomes you heartily. Take charge of your future. Discover Parker for yourself. Working in the frontline helping Parker Hannifin's Key Clients\nIn the Systems Engineer role you can step into the international team of 18 professionals. You are helping multiple Parker's key clients in different kinds of engineering projects. In many cases you are the go to person who people turn to when it comes to providing the best solutions and components for Parker's clients operating in the mobile sector (material handling machines, reach stackers, mining equipment etc.)\nYou are usually working with multiple long term projects simultaneously. One of the best parts about this position is the fact that you can often see the whole project lifecycle all the way from initial conversations to commissioning. You work closely with Parker's manufacturing divisions, other engineers and sales team in finding the best possible technical solution for the clients. Even though you do not have commercial responsibility you are often doing sales by bringing the technical expertise that solves client challenges to the table.\nThere is no typical week in this role. However often you can find yourself from doing the following: helping the customers at their premises, attending weekly team meetings, finding out what is the best technical solution for client needs, working with simulation tools, drawings or schematics and co-operating with your colleagues in order to bring out the best possible outcome for the needs of the clients.\nWe are seeking for three factors:\nExperience:We are looking for a person with an engineering degree. You can be an experienced professional and for this role we are looking for someone with at least +2 years of relevant experience from the industrial field.

The preferred location for this position is Borås and secondary location is Tampere. Position comes with traveling domestically and internationally and you need to have a valid driver's license. Language wise English is a must, German is considered a benefit.\nInteraction:You are stepping into a very talented international team that is full of doers. Team is very passionate about providing the best possible service for its clients and developing themselves in order to constantly be able to deliver top notch service. We are hoping that you share the same ideologies when it comes to being on top of the wave of motion control technologies and placing customer service as top priority. You are comfortable when it comes to interacting with internal stakeholders and giving out presentations for clients. You like to work in the customer interface and are someone who makes the difference not only with your expertise but also with your positive personality.\nHumanity:Kindness & respect. These are two main things that you need to have in Parker's organization. You value and respect others and want to work in an international environment. You are ambitious with a goal to to succeed in your role but your ambition comes with humbleness instead of arrogance.Position is sometimes hectic with a lot going on and sometimes projects might move frustratingly slow. However, you can still keep an optimistic attitude and see opportunities in places where others might only see obstacles!\nWhy Parker?At Parker Hannifin you can work in an international Fortune 250 company with a lot of career opportunities. Stepping into a global leader in the motion control technologies will not only give you a lot of room to learn but also an environment that will constantly develop and move forward with eyes set on the future. At Parker Hannifin people are valued and the well-being of employees is one of the top priorities. No wonder careers tend to be long at Parker!Your salary is a combination of base salary and possible annual bonus.\nHow to apply:This recruitment is done in a co-operation with Parker Hannifin´s recruitment partner Nawia Oy.
